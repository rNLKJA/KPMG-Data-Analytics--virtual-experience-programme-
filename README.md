## [Data Quality Assessment](https://www.theforage.com/modules/m7W4GMqeT3bh9Nb2c/S3uFvbDL49EA43ukg?ref=SfSqDihCcvSen4csq)
Assessment of data quality completeness in preparation for analysis.

### Background information
Sprocket Central Pty Ltd  , a medium size bikes & cycling accessories organisation, 
has approached Tony Smith (Partner) in KPMG’s Lighthouse & Innovation Team. 
Sprocket Central Pty Ltd  is keen to learn more about KPMG’s expertise in its Analytics, 
Information & Modelling team. 

Smith discusses KPMG’s expertise in this space (you can read more [here](https://home.kpmg/au/en/home/services/advisory/management-consulting/digital/data-analytics-modelling.html)). 
In particular, he speaks about how the team can effectively analyse the datasets to help 
Sprocket Central Pty Ltd grow its business.

Primarily, Sprocket Central Pty Ltd needs help with its customer and transactions data. 
The organisation has a large dataset relating to its customers, but their team is unsure 
how to effectively analyse it to help optimise its marketing strategy. 

However, in order to support the analysis, you speak to the Associate Director 
for some ideas and she advised that “the importance of optimising the quality of customer datasets cannot be underestimated. 
The better the quality of the dataset, the better chance you will be able to use it drive company growth.”

The client provided KPMG with 3 datasets:
- Customer Demographic 
- Customer Addresses
- Transactions data in the past 3 months
You decide to start the preliminary data exploration and identify ways to improve the quality of Sprocket Central Pty Ltd’s data.

### Missions
You arrive at your desk after the initial client meeting. You have a voicemail on your phone which contains the following instructions.

[Voice transcript below]

> “Hi there – Welcome again to the team! The client has asked our team to assess the quality of their data; 
as well as make recommendations on ways to clean the underlying data and mitigate these issues.  
Can you please take a look at the datasets we’ve received and draft an email to them identifying 
the data quality issues and how this may impact our analysis going forward? I will send through an example 
of a typical data quality framework that can be used as a guide. Remember to consider the join 
keys between the tables too. Thanks again for your help.”

[Read email below]

> As per voicemail, please find the 3 datasets attached from Sprocket Central Pty Ltd:
> - Customer Demographic 
> - Customer Addresses
> - Transaction data in the past three months
> Can you please review the data quality to ensure that it is ready for our analysis in phase two. Remember to take note of any assumptions or issues we need to go back to the client on. As well as recommendations going forward to mitigate current data quality concerns.
> I’ve also attached a data quality framework as a guideline. Let me know if you have any questions.
> 
> Thanks for your help.
> 
> Kind Regards
> Your Manager

You need to draft an email to the client identifying the data quality issues and strategies to mitigate these issues. 
Refer to "Data Quality Framework Table" and resources below for criteria and dimensions which you should consider.

### Resources

**Data Quality Framework Table**
Below is a list of the Data Quality dimension our team may use to evaluate a dataset. 
Some of these terms are common to the whole industry, so you may find more information and clarity on these terms by searching online.

### General approach

Before state the problems you find, you should write a general report about the current dataset. 
Including the number of data entries, data types, values, your understanding etc. Note, this might 
be different from the data dictionary provided from your client, but it always a good start to 
help you dive into the data and understand it's meaning.

Except figure out the problems exist in any dataset. You should also propose a solution that could help you
align with your client understanding. To state the issue, it's always a good idea that using a form instead of a long paragraph.

At the end the process, you should also state the current
workflow status and continue process the data. 

Some of the phrase you may want to use.
> Moving forward, the team will continue with the data cleaning, standardisation and transformation process for the purpose of model analysis. Questions will be raised along the way and assumptions documented. After we have completed this, it would be great to spend some time with your data SME to ensure that all assumptions are aligned with Sprocket Central’s understanding.
